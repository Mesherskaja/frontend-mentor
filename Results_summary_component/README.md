## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pseudo-elements : before, : hover
- Pseudo-class selector: root

### Continued development
Improving CSS skills and implementing JS are priority positions.

### Useful resources
